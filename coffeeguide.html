                    <p>A single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water. Many like to drink this as they would a regular brewed coffee with milk and sugar. Purists say to keep milk to a minimum to get the most flavor from the espresso.</p>

                    <p>A cafe latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso-based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to espresso due to the steamed milk.</p>
